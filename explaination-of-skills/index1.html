    <h1>Strong Communication Skills</h1>
    <p>Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place, person or group to another.<br>
    Every communication involves (at least) one sender, a message and a recipient. This may sound simple, but communication is actually a very complex subject.The transmission of the message from sender to recipient can be affected by a huge range of things. These include our emotions, the cultural situation, the medium used to communicate, and even our location.<br> The complexity is why good communication skills are considered so desirable by employers around the world: accurate, effective and unambiguous communication is actually extremely hard.
